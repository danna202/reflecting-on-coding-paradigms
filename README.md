 **reflecting-on-coding-paradigms** 

In this activity, we will get a chance to express what we've learned so far in regards to the paradigms of Functional and Object-Oriented Programming in Python. The activity will be completed in a few distinct stages. The first step will consist of implementing a solution to a problem for each coding style. Once a solution that adheres to the coding paradigm has been implemented, there are several questions to answer. These questions pertain to how and why the coding paradigm in question helps us solve the problem. When answering these questions, it may be helpful to envision an interview setting. The final part of the activity consists of a writing prompt to reflect on the past two modules, and your personal impressions of them.


**Acceptance Criteria**

When scrolling through your Replit, it should be easy to tell what section your solutions belong to with commented titles.
When running your Replit, there should be no errors displayed in the console.
If there are errors you could not solve, comment out the lines throwing errors and explain what steps you used to try and fix them.
Make sure your thought question answers are commented out.
Given an array of integers in random order, running it through your pure function solution should sort it in ascending order.
Given a pod created from your defined Podracer class, running pod.repair() and printing the pod.condition afterwards should display "repaired" in the console.
Given another new_pod created from your defined AnakinsPod class with a max_speed of 2, running new_pod.boost() and printing the new_pod.max_speed afterwards should display "4".
Given a third_pod created from your defined SebulbasPod class, running third_pod.flame_jet() and printing the third_pod.condition afterwards should display "thrashed" in the console.
